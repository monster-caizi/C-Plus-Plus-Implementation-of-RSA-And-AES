# C-Plus-Plus-Implementation-of-RSA-And-AES
This project is C++ implementations of RSA and AES, which are famous in computer security.

* The project of RSA implements operator overloading for large integersto satisfy the basic requirement of RSA. Besides, the demo has the function of RSA algorithm. However, because of the difficulty to find out a large random prime number, the demo only generates  small random prime number to test. It is the point to further improve.
* The project of AES is a simple implementation to test the AES algorithm by using the the functions of rijindael-lag-fst.cpp and rijindael-lag-fst.h in the official release of the AES algorithm for encryption and decryption.   The detail functions of AES lacking in the demo are the points to further improve.
