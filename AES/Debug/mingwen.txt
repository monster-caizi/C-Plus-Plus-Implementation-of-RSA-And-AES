Viewed as three-dimensional (3D) analogue of graphene and with linear energy dispersion in bulk, Dirac semimetals have been intensively studied recently due to their potential impact on information technology. Several materials such as Cd3As2 are predicated to be Dirac semimetal, while most of which are not layered materials which are hard for Nano device fabrication and further application.
